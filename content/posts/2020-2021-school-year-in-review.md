summary: Wrapping up the 2020-2021 school year with recap, highlights, and financial report
---

2020 was an important year, and one that many families will likely remember for a long time.

COVID-19 caused many hardships, impacting the health and wellness of families around the world.
Lock downs caused work and school to be redefined.

A positive to come out of 2020 though, was Child Inclusion Fund.

It takes a surprising amount of time and work to set up a charity
We chose to hire a lawyer (not funded with CIF dollars) to help guide us through the process, to give us the peace of mind that we were correctly doing the necessary steps.
When waiting for responses from organizations like the IRS, we worked on setting up things like this website, and our Facebook page.

By the time we were officially a 501(c)(3) designation, our website was up and we were already getting an exciting amount of donations!

We were thrilled to be able to help families with purchasing spiritwear for field day, and are very excited to keep the ball rolling into next school year.
