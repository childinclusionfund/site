summary: Wrapping up the 2021-2021 school year with recap, highlights, and financial report
---

We had a really impressive amount of money come into Child Inclusion Fund throughout the school year, and wanted to say thank you so much to all our donators and supporters!

This year we were able assist a number of students interested in playing musical instruments by covering the cost of rentals.
This excites us since studies show that playing an instrument helps with academic performance.
They also give students an outlet for creativity.

Not sure if you've looked at the cost of instrument rentals, but they average between $150-$250 dollars!
This results in a barrier of entry for students and their families - one that we can help with getting around.


We were also able to help support local Gay Straight Alliance (GSA) clubs with their Day of Silence and Breaking the Silence events.
National Day of Silence is about bringing attention to the violence against LBGTQ students by taking a vow of silence as protest.
Breaking the Silence is immediately after the Day of Silence event, where students gather and discuss their thoughts on topic related to the LBGTQ community.

We purchased pronoun buttons for student, supplies for the celebration, and covered food and drinks for the Break the Silence celebration.

See GLSEN's [Day of Silence page](http://dayofsilence.org "GLSEN Day of Silence page") and [Break the Silence infographic](https://www.glsen.org/sites/default/files/2020-06/Day%20of%20Silence%20Breaking%20the%20Silence.pdf "GLSEN Break the Silence infographic") for more information.

#### Highlights

* October 2021 - We were able to identify and support 3 students with the cost of music instrument rentals
* October 2021 - A Facebook birthday donation campaign helped bring in **a lot** of money.  Due to the amount of time between campaign ending and checks arriving, it is reflected in December on balance sheet
* November 2021 - Like in October, we were able to support 3 more students with the cost of music instrument rentals
* April 2022 - Helping GSA clubs with their Day of Silence and Breaking the Silence events
