summary: Update on some expenses outside of the school year
---

Nothing too major to report here, a nice quiet summer.

Except, we unfortunately had to file our taxes ðŸ‘Ž.
That's never fun, and a little scary - don't want to lose our 501(c)(3) status!
Because of this, we opted to leverage a company to handle the taxes on our behalf, hence the expense.
Glad it was done correctly though.

Looking forward to the start of the school year!
