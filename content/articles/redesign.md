We decided to redesign the site.

The original site accomplished its primary goals of providing an overview of who we are and what we are trying to do, as well as displaying links for donations, Facebook, and our email address.


What it failed to do though, was give us a place to post updates about the charity.
And it didn't look all that great.
The aesthetics were utilitarian, and was a secondary concern when compared to the content, which was a secondary concern to 'just getting something out there'.

The new site should allow us to post updates about donations coming in, donations going out, and potential events.

That could have been built into the existing design, but the level of effort to support that functionality is very close to that of doing a full redesign.

So, the site was re-worked.

Originally custom built with [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org), the site is now using popular static-site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
Out-of-the-box blog support, nicely designed template themes (like [ananke](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/gohugo-theme-ananke/)), and markdown support.
These are a few of the features we're leveraging to accomplish the objectives listed above.
