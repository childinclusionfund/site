Amanda, a social worker, saw the disparities present amongst children from lower income families and saw how they affected the child&amp;rsquo;s experience in school.
Amanda had a client who, on picture day, was not getting any individual pictures and was only getting the class picture. This was because the student&amp;rsquo;s family could not afford an individual picture package.</description></item><item><title>Contact Us</title><link>http://childinclusionfund.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://childinclusionfund.com/contact/</guid><description>You can email us using the form below, or email us directly
