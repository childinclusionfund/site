The original site accomplished its primary goals of providing an overview of who we are and what we are trying to do, as giving us a place to put link for donations, Facebook, and our email address.
What it failed to do though, was give us a place to post updates about the charity. And it didn&amp;rsquo;t look all that great. The aesthetics were utilitarian, and were a secondary concern when compared to the content, which was a secondary concern to &amp;lsquo;just getting something out there&amp;rsquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
