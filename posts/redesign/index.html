The aesthetics were utilitarian, and were a secondary concern when compared to the content, which was a secondary concern to &lsquo;just getting something out there&rsquo;.</p><p>The new site should allow us to post updates about donations coming in, donations going out, and potential events.
And cool little postsl ike this.</p><p>That could have been built into the existing design, but the level of effort to support that functionality is very close to that of doing a full redesign.</p><p>So, the site was re-worked.</p><p>Originally custom built with <a href=https://nuxtjs.org>NuxtJS</a>, the site is now using popular static-site generator <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a>.
Out-of-the-box blog support, nicely designed template themes (like currently used <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/gohugo-theme-ananke/>ananke</a>), and markdown support;
these are a few of the features we&rsquo;re leveraging to make the site better for you and easier for us.</p><p>The redesign isn&rsquo;t complete though, so there will be some small changes to address things we dislike along the way.</p><ul class=pa0><li class=list><a href=/tags/technical class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">technical</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-dark-blue bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://childinclusionfund.com/>&copy; Child Inclusion Fund 2022 - a 501(c)(3) organization</a><div><div class=ananke-socials><a href=https://www.facebook.com/childinclusionfund target=_blank class="facebook ananke-social-link link-transition stackoverflow link dib z-999 pt3 pt0-l mr1" title="Facebook link" rel=noopener aria-label="follow on Facebook——Opens in a new window"><span class=icon><svg style="enable-background:new 0 0 67 67" viewBox="0 0 67 67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M28.765 50.32h6.744V33.998h4.499l.596-5.624h-5.095l.007-2.816c0-1.466.14-2.253 2.244-2.253h2.812V17.68h-4.5c-5.405.0-7.307 2.729-7.307 7.317v3.377h-3.369v5.625h3.369V50.32zM33 64C16.432 64 3 50.569 3 34S16.432 4 33 4s30 13.431 30 30S49.568 64 33 64z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd"/></svg></span><span class=new-window><svg height="8" style="enable-background:new 0 0 1000 1000" viewBox="0 0 1e3 1e3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M598 128h298v298h-86V274L392 692l-60-60 418-418H598v-86zM810 810V512h86v298c0 46-40 86-86 86H214c-48 0-86-40-86-86V214c0-46 38-86 86-86h298v86H214v596h596z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd;fill:"/></svg></span></a></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
